This simple program let you find topics from StackOverFlow by tag, 
number of upvotes and from any day until now.

First writable label is for tags. It could be anything as long as it is a tag from StackOverFlow.


Left writable label let you sort by upvotes. If u type 5, then it is 5,6,7,8...
Right writable label let you sort by day passed. If u type 5, then it is 5,6,7,8...

Upvotes and days have to be integers. I've made conversion from any type to integer,
but if you type non-integer it will do nothing for some reason.

There are three txt files. Readme, which you are reading, temp_pages pages and saved_pages.

Temp_pages stores links for current search, and if u accidentaly close app, 
your last search is saved here.

Saved_pages stores links from current search, and all searches before. 
To add pages to saved_pages click: 'Save to txt file' button

'Open pages in web' button, automatically opens all current search pages in your main web browser. 
Current pages are showed on big label on SE (and saved in temp_pages)
